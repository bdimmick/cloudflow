# cloudflow

**Overview**:

Cloudflow is a simple libary that provides a framework for creating and executing workflows in a Java process without the 
step definitions of the workflows being explicitly tied to one another.  This loose coupling ties only the steps to the
compiled product and allows the workflow definition to be injected at runtime.
